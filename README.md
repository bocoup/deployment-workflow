# Modern Web Deployment Workflow

The files and directory you care about are:

* [Vagrantfile](Vagrantfile)
* [ansible.cfg](ansible.cfg)
* [.gitignore](.gitignore)
* [deploy/](deploy/)

Everything else is used to generate the [project home page][home], which is just
a stylized version of the main project documentation
([deploy/README.md](deploy/README.md)). And yes, the deployment workflow
homepage is deployed using the deployment workflow.

[home]: https://deployment-workflow.bocoup.com/

If this is your first time here, you should start by reading [the
documentation][home].
