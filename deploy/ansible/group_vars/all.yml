# Certain tasks may operate in a less secure (but more convenient) manner, eg.
# enabling passwordless sudo or generating self-signed ssl certs, when testing
# locally, in Vagrant. But not in production!
env: production

# This var is referenced by a few other vars, eg. git_repo, hostname, site_fqdn.

# This is what you'll see at the bash prompt if/when you ssh into your server.
hostname: "{{project_name}}"

# This is the fully qualified domain name of your production server. Because
# nginx checks this value against the URL being requested, it must be the same
# as the server's DNS name. This value is overridden for Vagrant and staging

# USERS

# Specified users will be added to the remote server, along with all specified
# public keys. Removing a user from this list does NOT remove them from the
# remote server! You need to set their state to "absent", remove all the other
# properties for that user, and re-run the "configure" playbook. Also, the
# shadow password (that user's sudo password) should be a hash, and NOT plain
# text!
#
# Generate a shadow password hash using the following command:
# openssl passwd -1 -salt $(openssl rand -base64 6) yourpassword
