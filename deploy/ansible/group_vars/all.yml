# This is the fully qualified domain name of your production server. Because

# USERS
#######

# Specified users will be added to the remote server, along with all specified
# public keys. Removing a user from this list does NOT remove them from the
# remote server! You need to set their state to "absent", remove all the other
# properties for that user, and re-run the "configure" playbook. Also, the
# shadow password (that user's sudo password) should be a hash, and NOT plain
# text!
#
# Generate a shadow password hash using the following command:
# openssl passwd -1 -salt $(openssl rand -base64 6) yourpassword
#
# ===================== VERY IMPORTANT NOTE, PLEASE READ =====================
# When creating a new project from the deployment workflow, PLEASE REPLACE THE
# USERS HERE WITH YOUR OWN USERS. If you leave these users, we'll all have
# access to your servers, which is something we really don't want.
# ============================================================================
#
# If you have no users to define here, set users to an empty array, like:
# users: []
