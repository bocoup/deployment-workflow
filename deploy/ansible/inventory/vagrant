# This inventory allows you to run playbooks via ansible-playbook instead of
# having to use "vagrant provision" every time. Develop and test deployment
# in vagrant before deploying to staging or production. This should match the
# config.hostsupdater.aliases setting specified in the Vagrantfile and the
# app_fqdn setting in the ansible "localdev" config.
