# Instead of cloning the Git repo and building like the "deploy" playbook, this
# playbook links your local working project directory into the Vagrant box so
# that you can instantly preview your local changes on the server, for
# convenience while developing. While in this mode, all building will have to
# be done manually, at the command line of your development machine. Running
# this playbook will override the deploy playbook, and vice-versa.
